### Steinmetz and Tesla's secret about "AC power"

Today's AC technology and radio technology are a mystery if we can ask questions about these two technologies. In this article, I will talk about the secret of "Electricity" AC. If you want to know the secrets of radio technology, see this article: Free Energy Tesla Coil

Only Tesla and CP Steinmetz knew how AC generators worked in the early days. After that, the truth about AC Power was hidden by the elites.

CP Steinmetz is a genius. Without CP Steinmetz and Tesla, today's AC electricity would not work, or AC power would be generated by someone else. 

## What is electricity?
---
Electricity is a general concept that refers to phenomena that are caused by stationary or moving charges as well as the electric and magnetic fields created by them. The charges have negative charges (such as electrons, also called electrons), and positive charges (such as protons and positive ions). Charged particles with the same sign repel each other; different marks attract, the corresponding forces are repulsive and attractive.
Exactly? Not entirely accurate, and even wrong! Because, according to Steinmetz, the pioneer of today's AC and later Tesla does not think there are particles that move when there is electricity.
Reading "Elementary Lectures on Electric Discharges, Waves and Impulses, and Other Transients" we will see no Electron or Ion in the transmission process. And even Electron doesn't exist.
Steinmetz mentions this in his introductory book Electric Discharges, Waves and Impulses. To quote, "Unfortunately, to large extent in dealing with dielectric fields the prehistoric conception of the electrostatic charge (electron) on the conductor still exists, and by its use destroys the analogy between the two components of the electric field, the magnetic and the dielectric, and makes the consideration of dielectric fields unnecessarily complicated. "

## How does it travel?
---
The electric current in metal is the flow of electrons
The current in the battery is due to the exchange of positive and negative ions, which then propagate at the speed of an electric field.
What about electricity in the brain? Many documents state that the brain electricity is also caused by the negative ions and ions
If according to C.P Steinmetz and Tesla, that is not true. And from the point of view of C.P Steinmetz or Tesla, there will be no charged particles traveling when electricity is transmitted. If you want to know exactly what goes on when electricity is transmitted, take a look at this article:
Is the nature of dielectricity a conspiracy or human ignorance
The Truth About the Electron does not Exist until it is Observed
Charges do not "travel". Want the easiest evidence? OK, got it We can measure the amperage at the neutral wire of the 3-phase power line, the results show that, no matter how many devices it consumes, the current at the wire is approximately zero. That proves that There is a wave propagating along the wiring of a 3-phase network.
To understand the transmission process, we must understand the following two things:
Dielectric in Ether

## What is intrinsic magnetism?

What powers our homes, and what comes back to the source?
No particles move on the power line. Remember this. So what goes back to the source?
It is still a dielectric in Ether, more specifically, it is a dielectric reflection.
Only Tesla and C.P Steinmetz know it, and they know how to refine AC generators, in the early days of AC power. If I reveal a little more, many issues will be revealed, including free energy generators. This is a breach of interests of today's electricity companies. One thing I've just learned from secrets: Keep quiet, be docile in wisdom, or be watched.
All of the above that I have presented are completely grounded. If there are any questions, we can [discuss them](https://homemade-generator-tao.blogspot.com/2020/07/secret-about-ac-power-by-steinmetz-and-tesla.html).
