# Free Energy: George Soukup's Magnet Motor

There used to be an interesting video on the internet, showing a magnet motor built on the “V” style of magnet placement which has two sets of permanent magnets spaced like this:

This style of magnet arrangement (North magnets shown in blue and South in red) has a locking point where the switch from wide spacing to narrow spacing occurs and this causes the rotation to stop there.

The taper is much less pronounced with an inner gap some four times greater than the gap to the outer ring. It also appears that the last inner magnet has a greater gap around the drum than the remaining ring of magnets.

The housing is very simple looking, with an evenly spaced ring of twelve holes to take long magnets with alternating North and South magnetised areas along their length. You will notice from the photographs, that George has cavities to take up to twelve stacks of stator magnets, although he only uses any five of them for his demonstrations.
